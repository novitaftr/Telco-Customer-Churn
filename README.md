# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, we aim to predict customer churn for a Telco using machine learning models.
The dataset contains information about customer demographics, services subscribed, and churn status.

## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers and maintain revenue. 
By identifying customers at risk of churning, companies can take proactive measures to prevent churn and improve customer retention.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships between features.
2. **Data Manipulation with Python**: Preprocess the dataset
3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Train machine learning models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for customer churn prediction.

## Outlines
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Explore the Telco Customer Churn dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
   - Visualize relationships between features, and identify potential patterns or trends.
### 2. Data Manipulation with Python
   - Preprocess the dataset
### 3. Machine Learning Models
   - Train machine learning models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms.
   - Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and test set evaluation.
   - Compare the performance of different models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Usage
1. **Dataset Setup**: Ensure that the Telco Customer Churn dataset is available in your working directory or specify the correct path to the dataset.
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies.
3. **Running the Notebooks/Scripts**: Execute the provided Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for EDA, Data Manipulation, and Machine Learning Models.
